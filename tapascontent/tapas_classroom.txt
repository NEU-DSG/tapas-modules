one repo with subdirectories
if a view package needs it's own repo, create a repo and make it a submodule of the view package repo
will eXist be able to look at a github repo, and get the different config files from the subdirectories?
   -- possible, but challenging

Config File
 * Machine Name
 * Human Readable Name
 * Brief description
 * {parameters}
 * Basic Information
    -- Syd: as much as possible for future develope
		-- static or dynamic
		-- single file, or multiple files/collection
		-- asset paths 
		    o CSS
				o Javascript
				o etc
 * Process steps for creating the output
    -- not sure what this means yet
		-- very Syd-centric, want to go greater depth when he 
 * Parameters
    -- Which parameters does this view package define?
		-- What are the legal values?
		-- what are the default values?

View packages will be at the file level, but have collection level defaults
if multiple collections with different defaults, ask user
(this is static, not dynamic)

Collection Level: 'Default' (what the preferred view package will be set to for a record loaded to that collection, if none other is specified. If a record is being loaded to multiple collections, will ask the user which of the defaults (or something else) to use for that record's Preferred view package.
Recrod Level: 'Preferred'


Parameters: What information does eXist need, beyond what's in the repo?
	-- mods (additional fields)
	-- booleans (flags for features we're using/not using) 
	-- enum values


Explicitly reference test files that check if this view package is appropriate for a tei file.

default permissions
(i.e. profiling view packages meant to be used by administrators rather than ordinary visitors)o

thus we need to figure out what the new role landscape is (when it involves permissions for view packages)
